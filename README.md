# **🚀 Credit Card Fraud Detection using Python & SQL**  

## **📌 Overview**  
This project analyzes credit card transaction data to detect fraudulent activities. Using Python and its libraries, we explore patterns in fraudulent transactions, visualize key insights, and generate reports to help in fraud detection.  

## **📂 Dataset**  
- **Source:** Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset  
- **Records:** 284,807 transactions  
- **Features:** Time, V1-V28 (anonymized), Amount, and Class (0 = Legitimate, 1 = Fraudulent)  
- **Imbalance:** Only 0.17% of transactions are fraudulent.  

## **🛠 Tech Stack**  
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)  
- SQL (For querying transaction data)  

## **📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
Key steps in the analysis include data cleaning, fraud distribution analysis, time-based fraud trend detection, transaction amount anomaly identification, and feature correlation study.  

## **📌 Project Structure**  
The project is organized into folders such as data (for dataset files), notebooks (for Jupyter notebooks), reports (for visualizations & findings), scripts (for automation), and main Python scripts for fraud detection.  

## **📈 Visualizations**  
This project provides insights into fraud detection through various visualizations such as transaction amount distribution (legit vs. fraud), time-based fraud patterns, correlation heatmaps, and fraud frequency by time of day.   

## **🎯 Key Findings**  
Fraudulent transactions tend to have lower amounts than normal transactions, occur within specific time windows, and show strong correlations between certain anonymized features, indicating potential fraud patterns.  

## **💡 Future Improvements**  
Potential improvements include automating fraud alerts using rule-based detection, integrating real-time transaction streaming for live fraud detection, and implementing dashboards using Power BI for better insights.
